                    <p>eCommerce is a React App utilizing the React Context API and React Hooks. The base of the app is built to be a boilerplate for future React projects; including the Airbnb style guide, Eslint, and Prettier, Enzyme and Jest testing, and OAuth through an in-company service.<br><br>Utilizing headless CMS Znode, I collaborated with a senior contractor and product designer to implement the re-design of our site, to keep it in line with updated brand guidelines. The re-design also gave us a great excuse to refactor a lot of the CSS.</p>
